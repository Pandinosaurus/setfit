# Overview

Welcome to the SetFit tutorials! These tutorials are designed to walk you through particular applications. For example, we'll delve into topics such as zero-shot text classification, where you'll learn how to use SetFit without any predefined labels or examples during training. See also the [SetFit Notebooks](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit/tree/main/notebooks) for more applications, such as hyperparameter searching and ONNX, though some might be outdated.

For more concise guides on how to configure SetFit or use it for specific forms of text classification, see the [How-to Guides](../how_to/overview) section.
