# Overview

Welcome to the SetFit How-to Guides! The how-to guides offer a more comprehensive overview of all the tools ðŸ¤— SetFit offers and how to use them.
These guides are designed to be concise and code-heavy, written in "show, don't tell" style. For example, using these guides you may learn how to perform hyperparameter optimization, knowledge distillation, apply callbacks, etc.

Most how-to guides end with an "end to end" script showing all code from the guide for easy adaptation into your own code.

For simpler documentation explaining SetFit functionality from start to finish, consider visiting the [Tutorials](../tutorials/overview) section or the [quickstart](../quickstart).
